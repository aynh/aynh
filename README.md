> "They say if you change yourself, you'll change the world, but that's a complete lie. When people judge somebody, it becomes a fixed idea and an impression that lasts. A loner is forced to stay a loner. If you do your best at something and stand out, that'll only get used as fodder for criticism. Those are the rules of the Kingdom of Children."
