> "It was rough. It was so painful. I was so scared. I was so sad. It hurt so much, I thought I'd die. I tried so hard... I tired so hard! I was so desperate, so desperate to make everything right! It's the truth. I've honestly never tried so hard at anything in my life! Because I loved this place... Because it was so important to me! I was so desperate to get back. I was scared... I was so scared! I didn't want those eyes looking at me like that again... And I hated myself so much for feeling that way!"
