> "If I were to compare a human’s heart with the ocean, the water would be stagnant. If I were to name the ripples on the water surface….Would it be happiness? Or anger? No. For this ocean, such a description is too shallow. If I want to know what lies upon the deep ocean floors… I would have to open my eyes in the stagnant water. Then swim downwards while enduring the icy deep kicking through the cold and heavy ocean waters. If I truly want to know the human known as myself….even if.. there is nothing there."
