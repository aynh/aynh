> "I'm not sure what you're talking about, but to atone for that you got mad and decided to do this alone? Rem... Super slap! For starters, are you dumb? No, you are dumb! Listen, where I'm from there's a saying, '3 heads are better than 1.' Wait, is it 2 heads? Whatever, the point is, 3 heads, thinking together are harder to break than only 1 arrow. It means you should rely on those around you instead of thinking about stuff alone!"
