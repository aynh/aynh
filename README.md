> "There are all sorts of goodbyes. There are sad goodbyes, and sometimes goodbyes you're thankful for, that take a load off your mind. It often happens that someone you say goodbye to unexpectedly returns, all self-conscious. Then there are times when, anticipating that, you put on the front of a short goodbye, only to have them not return so soon. And then there are goodbyes that last forever, true goodbyes that only happen once in your life."
