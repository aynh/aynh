> "There is no telling what kind of pain will come  after me, but... if I stop believing because of that, if the hero should change, it'll turn into another story from the one my master left behind. Then it wont be Naruto! I can't write novels like my master did. That's why the sequel has to come from the life I live no matter how great the pain, I'll continue walking because that's who Naruto is!"
