> "However, I can't be happy. I feel I can't have that experience, I can't assume I will have that experience. I'm free, but feeling lonely and disheartened. I hope there's happiness out there. Besides, the future is approaching and waiting for me. In the future, I will be a part of the world. I will finally live my life."
