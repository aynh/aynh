> "It's difficult to change someone's emotions, no matter how they are, so long as they are deeply engraved in the heart. I suppose hatred would be the hardest. Many people will say that hatred fades over time, but that doesn't mean it ever really goes away. It's still there. It's just hiding where you can't see it, and given the slightest chance, it will reassert itself. Now then, given hatred's persistence, what should you do if you can't get rid of it? The only possibility is to overwrite it with an equally powerful emotion – with an emotion as strong as hatred… Yes, those would be love and trust."
