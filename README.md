> "I had a lot of dreams as a child. I wanted many people to listen to the piano. I wanted to fly. I wanted to communicate with animals. Those dreams have all pretty much come true. Right now, I have a different dream. What mankind can imagine is what mankind can make into a reality. The imagination is a weapon. It is far superior than anything else in the world."
