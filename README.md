> "Knowing what's in store for me means I have nothing to look forward to. If I know something good's going to happen... then when it does, I'm only half as happy about it because I knew in advance. And then when I know something bad is going to happen... when it does, I get overwhelmed with this sense of defeat... and feel even worse."
