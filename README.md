> "[thinking to self about her past, and when she first met Kenpachi] I had no name. I had no parents. I was from District 79, 'Kusajishi', of the North Alley of Rukongai. I had never seen anything in colors other than the bloody red... Everyone was more beast than human. It wouldn't have been strange to have a baby get stepped on and die. But then you appeared. From District 80, 'Zaraki', of the North Alley of Rukongai. You appeared to me from even deeper in the darkness. You demolished the chaotic world that was dyed in blood... And then, you gave me a name. If it wasn't for you...I wouldn't be alive today. Yes...Since that day...You've been everything to me in this world."
