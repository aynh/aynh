> "No matter how colossal a power you obtain, no matter how gigantic an army you bring with you, I ain't scared. While you've abandoned a hundred, I've connected with a thousand. While you've destroyed a thousand, I've been helped by ten thousand. So what's an army of a few thousand? We have protected everything as just three people. We're the Yorozuya."
