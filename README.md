> "It's not that I'm not sure or anything. I actually don't want to think about it. It's not that I don't care about the future, but I'm mystified as to why I should have to be in a rush to narrow things down right this minute. It's not that I'm trying to escape from it, but I want a little more of what I have now, easy and... or rather, spending time having fun. That's kind of how I feel."
