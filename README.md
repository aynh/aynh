> "The gods have, since ancient times, created methods to test humans. The system God has created... it opposes all living creatures and splits the world. It condemns people to roles. Heaven pretends they can't see the suffering of the people. Only the lucky few find the way. The pain of those beings reaches deep into my heart. I want to counter this discrimination and extend a helping hand. In order to do that, the only thing that can be done is to create a new system! See... this is what God has wrought... I cannot allow such a system to continue! This is the will of my quarrel with Heaven. I would like you to come with me. If I had your help, even the weak-of-heart could have their wishes fulfilled. So that everyone can be equal and happy, I wish to reach out."
