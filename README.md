> "Teresa had plenty of chances to kill Priscilla. The reason she didn't was that after being with you, Teresa's heart lost the toughness of a warrior. The Teresa I knew would have dispatched Priscilla without hesitation at their first encounter. After she met you, she was no longer fit for battle. That's why she died. That's the truth. But I think Teresa was happy."
