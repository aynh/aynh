> "I only have one chance to have my life, and it's right here. It's the only life I have. This is my life. I can't give it to anyone else, It can't be stolen, I can't force it on anyone, or forget it, or make it disappear, or trample on it, or laugh it away, or beautify it. I have no choice but to accept this one cruel, meaningless life! That's why I will fight, and why I will continue fighting."
