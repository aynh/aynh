> "You see, there was this girl and she just appeared out of the blue. To my surprise, she was the same kind of person as me, and she had the same kind of eyes, at first sight, I realized I wasn't a solitary existence in this world, I was so happy. That's right, until I met her, I was all alone in this world, I had not a soul with whom to share the scenery before my eyes, and not a soul with whom to share the music in my ears. But...I heard the voices all over the world, I could hear the whole world crying out, 'save me'. It's true, thus I could see the optimal path of the world. But it saddened me, because the moment I saw her - I knew we were never meant to be, yes, she refused to side with me. She rejected me - the only person who could see the same scenery."
