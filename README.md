> "Fortitude is about staying cool and calmly analyzing your opponent. Do you know why? It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them not want to take another pass at you, to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wash it off, to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over, to completely, perfectly, thoroughly beat them until they can't get up!"
