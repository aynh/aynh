> "(gazing at Zuko with a dark look) You might have everyone else buying your... 'transformation', but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. So let me tell you something right now. You make one step backward, one slip up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends, right then and there. Permanently. (exits the room, leaving Zuko shocked)"
