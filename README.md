> "It hasn't withered. I won't let it wither. We might just be little branches, but if the branches break off, the tree really will wither. That's why I won't break off. Even if winter comes and the leaves fall off, even if the wind comes and all the other little branches break off... Even if I am the last branch left, I won't break off. I'm sure we'll be together till the end."
