> "Imagine what'd happen if I let someone like you loose on a bunch of politicians and scientists. You'd have them brainwashed in three days flat. First, you'd whisper your promises into their ears, getting them interested, and before they knew it, they'd be eating out of your goddamn hand. One of those scientists would say, 'Hey, this Huey fella, I think he's a really swell guy. We should talk to him and see what sort of information he might share with us'. And you can bet your ass by that point his brain would already be dribbling out his ears. Then oh, look, a strap on your straight jacket came loose, and oh, the next day they walk in and find out everyone in the lab is dead, and oh, Huey fucking Laforet is nowhere to be fucking seen! Oh no, oh what ever shall we fucking do Mr. Talbot, please do something even though you told us this exact thing was going to happen and we ignored you like the fucking idiots we are... and then they'll try and get me to find you, but you know what? I'll say no! Lemme say that again! No! Once more for good measure! Read my lips! Enn! Oh! No!"
