> "Strangely enough, when you get older, the things you didn't understand when you were a child... start to make sense. 'When this happened, I should have done that.' 'When that happened, I should have said this.' Those types of things. You start to understand rather than regret. It may be closer to repentance. So it may be that I do want to repent and erase the ignorant self from my childhood. Maybe that's what they mean when they say adults are selfish."
