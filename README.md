> "Mom taught me that people's differences are something to celebrate. When I thought of all the different shapes of human kindness -- imagining them as round or square...I got really excited. Your kindness is like a candle Sohma-kun. I can feel it light up, and I just want to smile. It's that kind of kindness."
