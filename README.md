> "Stand up! lift your faces! Take up your weapons! Look at that boy. He's so weak and fragile a breath could blow him away and he's unarmed! He is a powerless boy, whose defeat I have seen with my own eyes! He's weaker than anyone else here! Yet he's shouting louder than anyone that we can still do this so how can we sit down, with downcast gaze? If our weakest man has not given up how is kneeling in defeat acceptable for us? Did you come this far to wallow in shame?"
