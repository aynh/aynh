> "That's probably true. I like talking with people. I wonder if speaking with me is boring though. Since once people talk to me, they'll never do it again. But I don't feel like starting a conversation either, since in the direction I ought to look, there are only people who I cannot talk to. That's why I look at the sky... It's strange how merely observing things can be so handy to kill time. It hurts that I get called a weirdo just for making a habit out of it and in the end it just makes me stare at the sky even more. I've probably always been like this. Thinking about it, there's nothing I can do about my passiveness. Waiting things out is just my nature. I'm sure that... things will get better someday..."
