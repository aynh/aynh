> "In the first place, the logic that says 'those who play games are kids' is itself an allusion, therefore one might say that shoehorning reality into your stubborn dualism is already a criticism of the self. In short, humans can only recognize reality through the filter called 'me' and so they are unable to escape the constraints of their uncanny existence."
