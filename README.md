> "This is the law of conservation of mass. Somebody's 'happiness' is somebody else's 'unhappiness'. That's why I tried to be a 'rubbish bin' for those guys who played othello on my back using white and black thumbtacks. My crying and screaming meant something, 'cause they were laughing... But I was wrong. It doesn't make sense, does it? If I enjoy being unhappy, that 'happiness' will make someone else 'unhappy'!"
