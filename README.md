> "People don't simply disappear from this world when they die. They only truly die when they are forgotten by those who are alive. That's why it doesn't matter whether I lived or died. No one knows of my existence, and I don't have I don't have a single friend. But... if you all won't forget about me... that is enough even if I die. With just that... I would be more alive than I ever have been."
