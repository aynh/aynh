> "Matsu, you said that people and fireworks bloom like beautiful flowers for an instant and then fade away. That may be true, but Matsu, even if it's only for a moment, I want you to bloom by my side and when you fade away... do so at my side. In return, I will... make beautiful flowers bloom by your side again and again."
