> "In my family; Father, Mother, and Grandmother all hated each other. I was the trash can into which they dumped their hatred. That's why I only thought about beautiful and warm things, fun things. But after I met you, I understood. No matter how many beautiful stories I made, they were all lies. Because the person telling the stories, me, was an ugly and dirty creature."
