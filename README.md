> "It's true that your luster may not have been as bright as gold. You only shined on occasion. You were always arguing and fighting. You have wavy hair. You were lazy. You were the king of sexual harassment. You never paid the rent. You paid your people late. Still, you were brighter than the fake glint of gold plating. When you were angry, your entire soul was enraged. When you laughed, you laughed with all your heart. Your silver was much more beautiful."
