> "Why did you run away, Chitoge-chan? No... I don't want this... I won't be happy with you just giving up... To end up liking the same person. It's painful, for sure but Chitoge-chan, you like him enough to not be able to face him again after that, don't you? Regardless of who ends up with him, I want to be satisfied when it happens. I thought for sure that you think the same way. Is there a reason why that can't happen? Tell me Chitoge-chan..."
