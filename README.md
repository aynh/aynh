> "Liars always say the same things. 'I'll believe in you. I'll protect you. I care about you.' I'll never believe that again... No one will ever protect me. I won't even think about it. I'll fight alone, live alone, and die alone. I know... I've felt it on my skin and in my body... That it's better not to believe in anyone than believe and be betrayed!"
