> "You said I should have forgotten everything and lived as a human, but... there's no way I could do that. At that time, Teresa was everything to me. Everything I lost... my life, my voice, even my joy in living... Teresa gave those back to me. Teresa gave me everything. So I had no choice but to move forward. I wasn't strong enough to forget all that and continue living."
