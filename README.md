> "Sincerity with respect to yourself! No matter what your objective... no matter who you are... if you are going to do something or not do something, that is a promise to yourself. And the one who keeps the promise, or breaks the promise, is you. No one else can be burdened with holding you to a promise that's made to yourself."
