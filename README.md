> "[To Ichigo] So you can withstand my Cero even without your mask... You've gotten stronger. Is it because you defeated Grimmjow? Or...Is it because of her? [Motions to Inoue] Or maybe because of your friends, still fighting down below. That girl is already one of us. Even if you manage to rescue her, that won't change. Rescuing her...Is meaningless."
