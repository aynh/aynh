> "Things would have been so much better back then... If we had heard each other's voices. I hate myself. I was selfish, and I never thought about anyone else's feelings. Since then, my classmates have all looked down on me. I've lived for seventeen years, and I haven't lived one of them as a good person. The only time I heard your voice was when we got into that fight. And what pisses me off the most is the fact that I haven't changed at all since back then! But.,. But now, I think I can understand what you were saying... Nishimiya. Me and you... Can we be... friends? Shit!! I went way too far!! I was just gonna apologize and get out of here! Why the hell did I end up asking her to be friends?... Why did I even say that?! Jeez, that's so embarrassing! How can you even say that?"
