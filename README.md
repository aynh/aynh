> "I always wished to be accepted by my surroundings. I tried to change myself for that reason. But, I don't care if I'm disliked. I don't care if I don't have a place where I belong. I don't mind if everybody rejects me starting tomorrow. I will even become a devil for the person who is trying to protect me."
